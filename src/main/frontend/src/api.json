  "Maybe the best thing to do is to follow the work of the best cinematographers!\n\nTry those ones :\n\n- **Emmanuel Lubezki**. He started with very sophisticated/artifical photography (*Sleepy Hollow*, *Baudelaire Orphans*...), and then became specialist of more realist/natural light, even if still sophisticated (*Tree of Life*, *Children of men*, *The Revenant*...). A taste for fine contrasts, for short focal, and difficult-amazing shots.\n- **Roger Deakins** (the one who did *Skyfall*). Very subtle photography, sometimes very simple (i watched *Doubt*, which is not a great films, just for the pleasure to see how he renders skins in the winter!). Here are some of his greatest work : almost all the Coen Brothers films (*The Man Who Wasn't There*, *No Country for Old Men*...), *The Assassination of Jesse James*, *The Village*, *Blade Runner 2049* (his more stylized work to this date in my opinion), *1917*...\n- **Pixar cinematrographers**. Go watch those movies again looking at the inspirational choices of light, the textures, the realism of light on unatural characters and forms... The more classy cinematography is the one made for *The incredible* and *Ratatouille* ; the most realistic light on the shorts *The Blue Umbrella* and *Piper* ; the bright color games on *Wall-E* (on which Deakins worked) and *Up*... Just look threw their filmography, even if the first films are a little raw.\n- **Harris Savides**. Incredibly inventive et diversified, passed away too early sadly. His best works are the crepuscular *Birth*, the weirdly precise and artificial image of *Zodiac*, the beautiful followings all in blur and different lights of *Elephant*...\n- **Claire Mathon**. A young french cinematographer, but she has already made two masterpieces: the color-rich *Portrait of the Lady in fire*, and the dreamy-grey-fluorescent *Atlantique*.\n- **Mario Bava**. The king of color. You can just watch the light of his own films (he was also a director), who are just made to serve such visions. Just type \"Mario Bava lighting\" on youtube to see what it looks like... My favorite is *The Whip and the Body*.\n- **Mark Lee Ping-bing**. The cinematographer of Hou Hsia-Hsien. Light poetry, very subtle, barely noticeable, like if light was a sensual thing. You can try two twin films: *Millenium Mambo* (which is all dark, night, crepuscular, artificial lights), and *Café Lumière* (which is all day light, glare, white summer light). His work on *The Assassin* is also incredible.\n- **Benoît Debie**, the man of neon light and hallucinations. You can try the Noé films (*Irreversible*, *Enter the Void*), *Spring Breakers*, and the films where Gosling gave him the car keys, in a way, it's like a cinematographer's playground : *Lost River*.\n\nOther names you can try: **Gregg Toland** (*Citizen Kane*), **Agnès Godard** (*Golden Door*), **Raoul Coutard** for cinematography in all liberty (*À bout de souffle*), **Gordon Willis** aka \"the Prince of Darkness\" as people called him (*Klute*), the shadows of **James Wong Howe** (*Pursued*), the simplicity and softness of **Pierre Lhomme** (*Maurice*), **Conrad Hall** (*Road to Perdition*), the once overpraised **Darius Khondji** (*Alien 4*, *Seven*...), the overhyped **Janusz Kamiński** (all recent Spielberg films)...",

Way ahead of its time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;"
